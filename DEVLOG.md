# Development Log

## Cyberpunk Rich Terminal Output Integration - 2025-04-23

### Description
Integrated the Rich library to provide colorful, cyberpunk-styled terminal output. Created a dedicated `Scribe` class to handle all user-facing output formatting with consistent color schemes. The implementation separates debugging logs from narrative/UI logs, enhancing the user experience while maintaining proper logging for debugging purposes.

All agent activities, narratives, and simulation events now render with appropriate colorization:
- Agent names in Neon Pink
- Credits in Neon Green
- Actions in Neon Orange
- Goods in Neon Blue
- Needs (rest/fun/food) in Neon Purple

The UI also includes box drawing characters and emoji indicators to create an immersive Mars colony simulation experience.

### Demand
Let's do a sprint to add rich rendering with colored output to our simulation runs. See these docs: @https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#quick-start  @https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text.html. The goal is that when we run the simulation with low log-level (WARNING or ERROR only), we see those rich prints that help the user see what the agents do and render any markdown in the narrator summaries.

We want the console user experience to be richer and colored, using cyberpunk neon-like colors to highlight consistently:
- agent names in Neon Pink
- credits in Neon Green
- Actions in Neon Orange
- Goods in Neon Blue
- Needs (rest/fun/food) in Neon Purple

# API Implementation - 2023-07-26

## Description
Refactored ProtoNomia to separate the simulation engine from the UI and created a FastAPI-based REST API with comprehensive endpoints for simulation and agent management. Implemented a headless CLI frontend that uses the API to run simulations with output matching the original CLI.

## Demand
> MAIN GOAL: MAKE OUR PROJECT AN API + FRONTENDS
> - Refactor @simulation.py to be an engine that runs headless separate from scribe
> - Extract ./headless.py a first frontend that prints EXACTLY as currently simulation.py run, but which works by running our serv aside, then calling our API!
> - The API must be a FastAPI architecture leveraging pydantic Models for typing and modern approach, see docs @FastAPI 
> - API must expose following endpoints:
> - /simulation/start with params to start one 
> - /simulation/status to print current status
> - /agent/add create a new agent, with agent model as json payload
> - /agent/kill by name xor by id kill agent
> - /agent/status info about a specific agent
> - /agent/update change anything of an agent: credit, needs, etc
> - make them REST proper, smart, generic, leverage models to dont repeat yourself
