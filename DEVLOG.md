# Development Log

## Cyberpunk Rich Terminal Output Integration - 2025-04-23

### Description
Integrated the Rich library to provide colorful, cyberpunk-styled terminal output. Created a dedicated `Scribe` class to handle all user-facing output formatting with consistent color schemes. The implementation separates debugging logs from narrative/UI logs, enhancing the user experience while maintaining proper logging for debugging purposes.

All agent activities, narratives, and simulation events now render with appropriate colorization:
- Agent names in Neon Pink
- Credits in Neon Green
- Actions in Neon Orange
- Goods in Neon Blue
- Needs (rest/fun/food) in Neon Purple

The UI also includes box drawing characters and emoji indicators to create an immersive Mars colony simulation experience.

### Demand
Let's do a sprint to add rich rendering with colored output to our simulation runs. See these docs: @https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#quick-start  @https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text.html. The goal is that when we run the simulation with low log-level (WARNING or ERROR only), we see those rich prints that help the user see what the agents do and render any markdown in the narrator summaries.

We want the console user experience to be richer and colored, using cyberpunk neon-like colors to highlight consistently:
- agent names in Neon Pink
- credits in Neon Green
- Actions in Neon Orange
- Goods in Neon Blue
- Needs (rest/fun/food) in Neon Purple
