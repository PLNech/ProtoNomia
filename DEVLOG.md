## Improved LLM Response Models with Validation

**Date:** 2025-04-20

**Description:**
Enhanced the LLM response models using Pydantic validators to ensure high-quality outputs:
- Added field and model validators to `NarrativeResponse`, `DailySummaryResponse`, and `AgentActionResponse` models
- Implemented content moderation for narrative outputs to filter inappropriate content
- Added coherence validation between titles, descriptions, and tags
- Updated the `OllamaClient` class to better support structured output generation
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Made OllamaClient more robust with direct JSON parsing when instructor package is not available

**Demand:**
Continue but ensure you use response models: @https://python.useinstructor.com/blog/2023/10/23/good-llm-validation-is-just-good-validation/#define-the-response-model-with-validators simplify llm interactions across @llm_narrator.py and @llm_agent.py thanks to these run headless.py and tests to validate your work

**Files:**

- Fixed compatibility issues with instructor package by adding manual JSON parsing fallback
- Fixed missing dependencies by ensuring proper installation of required packages

## Fixed Instructor Patching Implementation

### Date
2025-04-24

### Description
Fixed critical issues with Instructor patching implementation that were causing runtime errors. Key fixes include:

1. Updated the OllamaClient to use the correct `instructor.patch()` approach instead of the deprecated `instructor.from_openai()` method
2. Removed unsupported `proxies` and other problematic keyword arguments from OpenAI client initialization
3. Modified how the patched client is accessed and used for structured outputs
4. Simplified the fallback mechanism to ensure compatibility with all Instructor versions
5. Added additional logging to help diagnose future integration issues

These changes ensure proper compatibility with the latest Instructor version and fix the runtime errors that were preventing the simulation from starting when using LLM features.

### Demand
Fix the AttributeError where "module 'instructor' has no attribute 'from_openai'" and the TypeError with unexpected "proxies" keyword argument.

### Files
- [M] `llm_utils.py` - Fixed Instructor patching implementation
- [M] `agents/llm_agent.py` - Minor updates to use the correct patching approach
- [M] `DEVLOG.md` - Added entry documenting the fixes

## Improved Ollama Integration with OpenAI Compatibility Layer

### Date
2025-04-23

### Description
Enhanced the Ollama integration to use the official OpenAI compatibility layer (v1 API) for more reliable structured outputs. Key improvements include:

1. Updated `OllamaClient` to primarily use Ollama's OpenAI compatibility API
2. Added graceful fallback to direct API when compatibility layer is unavailable
3. Improved connection testing to detect and verify compatibility API availability
4. Switched from JSON_SCHEMA to JSON mode for better model compatibility
5. Implemented proper validation of the compatibility API during initialization

These changes further improve reliability and performance of LLM interactions by leveraging Ollama's built-in OpenAI compatibility, which provides better handling of structured outputs and follows the same interface as our standard OpenAI client, simplifying maintenance.

### Demand
Reimplement with patch using Ollama's official OpenAI compatibility layer as documented in the Instructor documentation.

### Files
- [M] `llm_utils.py` - Updated to use Ollama's OpenAI compatibility layer with fallback to direct API

- Added graceful degradation when OpenAI compatibility layer is unavailable
- Improved error reporting and fallback mechanisms

## Refactored LLM Interactions to Use Instructor for Improved Structured Output

### Date
2025-04-22

### Description
Refactored the LLM interaction code to leverage the Instructor library for structured outputs. Key improvements include:

1. Created Pydantic models for all structured LLM responses in a new `llm_models.py` file
2. Implemented an `OllamaClient` class that provides OpenAI-compatible interfaces with Instructor integration
3. Added automatic retries with exponential backoff for improved reliability

2. Fixed the `generate_narrative_from_interaction` method to properly handle agent data
3. Added a demo interaction generator to the simulation step to ensure narrative events are created
4. Updated method signatures to be consistent with parameter expectations

These changes ensure that narrative events are properly generated during simulation runs and that the test mode functionality works correctly for unit testing.

### Demand
Continue, it's far from working for now I see no interaction nor narrative event: python headless.py --initial-population 5 --ticks 5 --verbosity 4 --use-llm --mock-llm --narrator-model-name "gemma3:1b" --temperature 0.9 --top-p 0.8 --top-k 50

## Implemented LLM-based Narrator

### Date
2025-04-20

### Description
Implemented a new LLMNarrator class that uses Ollama to generate narrative content for the simulation. The LLMNarrator extends the base Narrator class and provides LLM-powered generation of narrative events and daily summaries. The implementation includes:

1. A new `narrative/llm_narrator.py` file with the LLMNarrator class
2. Tests for the LLMNarrator in `tests/test_llm_narrator.py`
3. Integration with the core simulation module to use LLMNarrator when `use_llm` is true
4. Addition of a `narrator-model-name` parameter to the headless script to control which model is used for narration
5. Fallback to rule-based narrative generation if the LLM fails
6. Parameters for controlling LLM generation: temperature, top-p, and top-k

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with the existing rule-based narrator while adding the option to use LLM-generated narratives for more creative and varied storytelling. The addition of LLM generation parameters allows fine-tuning the creativity and diversity of the generated narratives.

## Test Refactoring and LLM Integration

### Date
2025-04-21

### Description
Refactored the test suite to separate unit tests from LLM integration tests, improving test organization and execution efficiency. Also fixed several implementation issues in the simulation code to ensure it runs correctly without depending on mock behavior.

Key accomplishments:
- Created tests/unit and tests/llm directories to separate test types
- Removed tests that validated mock behavior
- Created proper LLM integration tests with appropriate environment variable controls
- Fixed compatibility issues in the Simulation class
- Added comprehensive documentation in DOCS.md
- Added pytest configuration to support test organization
- Fixed resource handling in the simulation to work with the current data model
- Successfully ran the simulation in headless mode

### Demand
Ok can you now remove any test that was validating mock behavior? and ensure we have tests validating llm calls, factorize them under tests/llm/ so that we know when we run tests/unit/ quick tests vs tests/llm/ longer-running ones.
Then continue your dev, ensure @design.md design is complete, validate your dev with tests and running headless script.
