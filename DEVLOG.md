# ProtoNomia Development Log

## Enhanced Ollama Connection Handling and Error Recovery

### Date
2025-04-20

### Description
Significantly improved the robustness of Ollama connection and API call handling. Key improvements include:

1. More comprehensive Ollama connection testing with detailed error logging
2. Automatic model selection if the specified model is not available
3. Enhanced error handling for various connection and API scenarios
4. Added more detailed logging for connection and generation processes
5. Implemented fallback mechanisms to prevent simulation interruption
6. Added response validation to ensure meaningful LLM outputs
7. Extracted common LLM utility functions into `llm_utils.py`

These changes make the LLM integration more resilient to network issues, service unavailability, and unexpected API responses.

### Demand
Fix connection bugs with Ollama, ensuring the simulation can run smoothly even with intermittent LLM service availability.

### Files
- [A] `llm_utils.py` - New utility module for common LLM interaction functions
   - Added `test_ollama_connection` for robust connection testing
   - Added `call_ollama` for standardized API calls
   - Added `parse_llm_json_response` for handling complex LLM responses
- [M] `narrative/llm_narrator.py` - Refactored to use `llm_utils.py`
   - Replaced inline connection and API call methods with utility functions
- [M] `agents/llm_agent.py` - Refactored to use `llm_utils.py`
   - Replaced inline connection and API call methods with utility functions

### Bugs
- Fixed connection error handling for Ollama API
- Added automatic fallback to mock mode when connection or model issues occur
- Improved error logging to help diagnose connection problems
- Added response validation to prevent using invalid or empty LLM responses
- Centralized error handling and connection logic in a shared utility module

## Improved LLM Narrator Error Handling and Logging

### Date
2025-04-20

### Description
Enhanced the LLM Narrator's robustness for handling various edge cases and improved logging to facilitate troubleshooting. Key improvements include:

1. Implemented more robust JSON parsing to handle malformed or unexpected response formats from the LLM
2. Added extensive logging throughout the LLM response flow to aid in debugging
3. Added exception handling for the event generation process with fallback event creation
4. Updated the typing_extensions dependency to address import issues
5. Added unit tests to verify correct handling of malformed JSON and responses with extra text
6. Improved HTTP error handling in the Ollama API client

These changes significantly improve the reliability of narrative generation, particularly when the LLM returns unexpected response formats.

### Demand
Be more flexible to extra data when parsing response; also log more so we can see what happens; run the headless llm yourself to validate and run the pytest too; TDD remember; and fix the TypeIs import error

### Files
- [M] `narrative/llm_narrator.py` - Improved JSON parsing, added detailed logging, and better error handling
- [M] `tests/test_llm_narrator.py` - Added new tests for malformed JSON and responses with extra text
- [M] `requirements.txt` - Updated typing_extensions dependency to fix compatibility issues

### Bugs
- Fixed JSON parsing errors when LLM returns extra data around the JSON content
- Fixed TypeIs import error by updating dependencies
- Added fallback event generation to prevent simulation failures

## Fixed LLM Narrator Test Mode and Demo Interactions

### Date
2025-04-20

### Description
Fixed issues with the LLMNarrator class and added demo interactions to showcase narrative generation. Key changes include:

1. Added the missing `test_mode` parameter to the LLMNarrator constructor
2. Fixed the `generate_narrative_from_interaction` method to properly handle agent data
3. Added a demo interaction generator to the simulation step to ensure narrative events are created
4. Updated method signatures to be consistent with parameter expectations

These changes ensure that narrative events are properly generated during simulation runs and that the test mode functionality works correctly for unit testing.

### Demand
Continue, it's far from working for now I see no interaction nor narrative event: python headless.py --initial-population 5 --ticks 5 --verbosity 4 --use-llm --mock-llm --narrator-model-name "gemma3:1b" --temperature 0.9 --top-p 0.8 --top-k 50

### Files
- [M] `narrative/llm_narrator.py` - Added test_mode parameter and fixed generate_narrative_from_interaction method
- [M] `core/simulation.py` - Added _create_demo_interaction method to generate sample interactions

### Bugs
- Fixed missing test_mode parameter in LLMNarrator constructor
- Fixed interaction creation issue that was preventing narrative events from being generated

## Implemented LLM-based Narrator

### Date
2025-04-20

### Description
Implemented a new LLMNarrator class that uses Ollama to generate narrative content for the simulation. The LLMNarrator extends the base Narrator class and provides LLM-powered generation of narrative events and daily summaries. The implementation includes:

1. A new `narrative/llm_narrator.py` file with the LLMNarrator class
2. Tests for the LLMNarrator in `tests/test_llm_narrator.py`
3. Integration with the core simulation module to use LLMNarrator when `use_llm` is true
4. Addition of a `narrator-model-name` parameter to the headless script to control which model is used for narration
5. Fallback to rule-based narrative generation if the LLM fails
6. Parameters for controlling LLM generation: temperature, top-p, and top-k

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with the existing rule-based narrator while adding the option to use LLM-generated narratives for more creative and varied storytelling. The addition of LLM generation parameters allows fine-tuning the creativity and diversity of the generated narratives.

### Demand
Implement an Ollama-based Narrator for the ProtoNomia simulation that generates narrative events and daily summaries using LLM models.
