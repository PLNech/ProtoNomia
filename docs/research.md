### 11. **Principal-Agent Contracts**  
Agents (employees) choose effort levels after a principal (employer) offers a contract, but effort is costly and only imperfectly observed[1][2][3].  
**Situation**: A company hires a manager to run a branch, offering a bonus based on end-of-year profits, but cannot directly observe the manager's work hours.  
**Variant**: Allow the principal to invest in monitoring technology that partially reveals agent effort.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Incentive compatibility: Do optimal contracts induce desired effort?  
- Moral hazard: Does hidden action reduce performance?  
- Monitoring vs. incentive tradeoff: Is increased monitoring always efficient?  

### 12. **Coordination Games (Stag Hunt)**  
Players choose between a safe, low-reward option or a risky, high-reward option that pays only if enough others also choose it.  
**Situation**: Two companies must decide whether to adopt a new industry standard; both benefit only if both switch.  
**Variant**: Introduce pre-play communication or public signals about intentions.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Equilibrium selection: Do agents coordinate on the payoff-dominant equilibrium?  
- Role of communication in risk dominance.  

### 13. **Signaling Games**  
One agent (sender) has private information and chooses a costly signal; the receiver observes the signal and acts accordingly.  
**Situation**: A job candidate chooses whether to obtain a degree (signal) before applying for a job.  
**Variant**: Vary the cost of signaling for high- and low-ability types.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Separating vs. pooling equilibria: Do signals credibly convey information?  
- Spence’s signaling theory: Does costly signaling improve market efficiency?  

### 14. **Beauty Contest**  
Players must guess a number based on what they think others will guess, typically a fraction of the average guess.  
**Situation**: Investors try to predict the average market price of a new asset, aiming for two-thirds of the average forecast.  
**Variant**: Repeat the game over several rounds to test learning and higher-order beliefs.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Level-k reasoning: Do agents iterate strategic thinking beyond first order?  
- Convergence to Nash equilibrium with experience.  

### 15. **Common Pool Resources**  
Multiple agents extract from a shared, finite resource, risking depletion if overused[6][8][9].  
**Situation**: Fishers harvest from a lake, with each catch reducing the future stock for all.  
**Variant**: Introduce community-based monitoring or punishment for over-harvesting.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Tragedy of the commons: Do agents over-extract absent regulation?  
- Ostrom’s theory: Can local governance sustain resources?  
- Impact of time preferences and group composition on sustainability[6].  

### 16. **Agent-Based Macro Models**  
Many heterogeneous agents interact locally, leading to emergent macroeconomic patterns.  
**Situation**: Simulate a city’s labor, goods, and housing markets with agents making decentralized decisions.  
**Variant**: Introduce policy shocks (e.g., tax changes) and observe aggregate outcomes.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Emergent order: Do micro-level rules yield macro-level regularities?  
- Robustness of equilibrium to agent heterogeneity.  

### 17. **Evolutionary Game Theory**  
Strategies evolve over time as successful behaviors proliferate through imitation or selection.  
**Situation**: Firms choose pricing strategies, and more profitable strategies are copied by others each round.  
**Variant**: Allow for random mutations (innovation) in strategy space.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Evolutionary stability: Do certain norms persist?  
- Replicator dynamics: Does population converge to Nash equilibrium?  

### 18. **Institutional Design Games**  
Agents can vote to create or modify rules (e.g., to punish free riders or set taxes).  
**Situation**: A community votes on whether to implement a tax to fund public goods.  
**Variant**: Allow for lobbying or asymmetric information about rule consequences.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Endogenous institution emergence: Do agents create efficient rules?  
- Second-order free rider problem: Will agents support costly enforcement?  

### 19. **Network Formation Games**  
Agents choose whom to connect with, balancing benefits of links against connection costs.  
**Situation**: Firms form R&D partnerships, benefiting from shared knowledge but paying to maintain each link.  
**Variant**: Randomly assign initial network structures or allow for link dissolution.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Efficiency of emergent network topologies (e.g., small-world, scale-free).  
- Stability of networks under changing costs/benefits.  

### 20. **Sabotage/Espionage Mechanics**  
Agents can invest in harming others’ outcomes or stealing information, at a cost to themselves.  
**Situation**: Rival firms may spend resources to disrupt competitors’ supply chains.  
**Variant**: Introduce penalties or detection risks for sabotage.  
**Theories to Test/Falsify**:  
- Robustness of cooperation to adversarial threats.  
- Optimal deterrence: Do penalties reduce sabotage without excessive cost?
