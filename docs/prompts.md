# MVP

## User
i want us to create ProtoNomia, a fun simulation that allows us to assess/illustrate/benchmark various economic theory principles.
e.g. testing cooperation vs defection in iterated prisoner's dillemma conditions

The project must be scientifically sound, yet entertaining and didactic and never boring.

Here's some research I made: PASTED
I want to run the multi agent simulation in python
but I would love to have the frontend a nice next.js app with realtime dashboard analytics etc
Can you suggest a project structure?
You can define pydantic types for the Backend python codebase Agents.
Define models that are flexible to represent economic interactions in a generic enough way to support implementing part, all, or more than, the above 20 interaction types.
Also we want this to be embedded in a kind of realistic economy to make it more narrative interesting. Setting is Cyberpunk, 2993, on Mars, where humans have a first solid implantation out of Terra, transplanetary economy's mostly digital and service-based, selling software and entertainment to Terra against material and goods that the local blooming industry doesn't already provide.
There should be a Narrator which produces a story from the Agents' interactions.
Hence they must birth, live, age, and die, to ensure a nice cycle.
Implement self-correcting population control mechanics.
MVP we implement basic lifecycle, population init, narrator, and a couple econ interactions. Mark TODOs for all the other requirements not satisfied yet.

## Thinking 

This is an interesting and ambitious project combining economic game theory with a narrative simulation set in a cyberpunk Mars colony. Let's break down what's needed and create a coherent project structure.
The user wants:

1. A Python backend for multi-agent economic simulations based on the provided economic games research
2. A Next.js frontend with real-time dashboard analytics
3. A cyberpunk narrative set in 2993 Mars with a digital/service-based economy
4. Agent lifecycle (birth, living, aging, death)
5. Population control mechanics
6. A Narrator component to create stories from agent interactions

Let's outline a project structure that accommodates these requirements while making it scientifically sound and entertaining.

### Project Structure
I'll design a modular architecture that allows for:

- Separation of concerns between simulation engine, economic models, agents, and narrative generation
- Flexibility to implement any of the 20+ economic interaction types
- Easy extension for future features
- Clean API between frontend and backend

Let's start by defining the high-level components:
#### Backend Components

1. Core Simulation Engine

Time management
Event system
Simulation state management

2. Agent System

Agent lifecycle management
Agent attributes and state
Agent decision-making framework

3. Economic Interaction Framework

Generic interaction model
Specific implementations of economic games
Market simulation

4. Narrator

Event tracking and filtering
Narrative generation
Story arc management


5. Population Controller

Birth/death mechanics
Migration patterns
Resource-based population controls


6. API Layer

REST/GraphQL endpoints
WebSocket for real-time updates
Authentication/authorization


#### Frontend Components

1. Dashboard

Real-time metrics
Economic indicators
Population statistics


2. Simulation Controls

Start/stop/pause
Speed controls
Parameter adjustments


3. Visualization

Network graphs for agent relationships
Charts for economic data
Agent activity maps


4. Narrative Display

- Story feed
- Agent profiles
- Historical events


Now, let's define the core Pydantic models for the backend:

#### Backend Models
I'll start with the core models needed for the simulation. These will be defined using Pydantic for type safety and validation.
Let's define our models to handle all the economic interactions mentioned in the research while keeping them flexible.
Now, I'll draft the key Pydantic models for the backend:

Now, let's consider the implementation files for key modules:

Continue creating the artifacts
Wait we forgot a big detail! Agents are LLM based. We are gonna send them a payload via ollama through a requests POST with timeout=5s and retry3 else agent passes this round, where the agent is told potential interaction parters, log of proposed interactions by others, can send accept/negotiate/reject response interactions, can choose strategies between resting/searching for job/working/buying goods/etc. Think about the above simulation models and interactions to define an action ontology and pydantic model, then use it in the prompt for the agents.

Example, we use this great small fast gemma:
ollama run gemma3:1b "You are an agent in a simulated economy. You currently have 5 dollars. You have 100/100 full stomach, are 100/100 rested. Your neighbors are [agent1, agent3, agent4]. You currently have: no job. Your possible interactions are REST/OFFER(what:str, against_what:str)/NEGOTIATE(offer_id:int, message:str)/ACCEPT(offer_id:int)/REJECT(offer_id:int)/SEARCH_JOB()/WORK(job_id)/BUY(desired_item:str). The turn is 122/200. What do youchoose to do? Think in max 20 words then return CHOICE:{'type':TYPE, 'extra':{}}. No comment after CHOICE only your choice in valid json." { 'type': "SEARCH_JOB", 'extra': "Look for available positions to earn more.'}
But improve my prompt add few shots constrain it more add Instructor for the pydantic modeling:
Start Here: Instructor for Beginners¶
Welcome! This guide will help you understand what Instructor does and how to start using it in your projects, even if you're new to working with language models.
What is Instructor?¶

## Thinking 
Let's continue developing the ProtoNomia project by focusing on the LLM integration for the agents. Based on the new information, I need to:

1. Design a Pydantic model for agent actions/decisions
2. Create a prompt system for the LLM agents
3. Implement the agent controller that will communicate with Ollama

I'll start with defining the Pydantic models for the agent actions and interactions.
First, I need to understand what actions agents can take in our economy:

REST - Rest to recover energy
OFFER - Make an offer to another agent
NEGOTIATE - Respond to an offer with a counter-proposal
ACCEPT - Accept an offer
REJECT - Reject an offer
SEARCH_JOB - Look for employment
WORK - Work at a job
BUY - Purchase goods

I'll create a model that captures these actions and the data needed for each one. Then I'll create a system to generate the appropriate prompts for the LLM agents.
For the agent prompt, I need to include:

Agent's current state (resources, needs, etc.)
Available actions
Information about other agents (neighbors)
Current economic situation
Recent history/memory

Let me design the Pydantic models for the agent actions and then create the agent controller.

## Response
Let's continue building ProtoNomia with the LLM agent integration. I'll create the agent action models and controller system using Instructor for structured outputs.

## User
Continue
## Thinking
Let's continue building the ProtoNomia project. So far, we've created:

Core models (models/base.py) - Defines the fundamental data structures for our simulation including agents, resources, interactions, and narrative components
Agent action models (models/actions.py) - Defines the actions agents can take and their data structures
Economic interactions (economics/interactions.py) - Implements the game theory interactions like Ultimatum Game, Trust Game, etc.
LLM agent controller (agents/llm_agent.py) - Handles the generation of agent decisions using LLMs
Narrative generator (narrative/narrator.py) - Creates storytelling elements from agent interactions
Simulation engine (core/simulation.py) - The main engine that ties everything together

Now we need to implement:

An API server to expose the simulation
A frontend for visualizing and interacting with the simulation
Any additional core components that are missing

## Response
Let's start with implementing the API server using FastAPI:

## User
Continue
## Thinking
I'll continue creating the final components for our ProtoNomia project. So far I've created:

Core models (Pydantic models for the simulation)
Economic interactions implementation
LLM agent controller
Narrative generator
Simulation engine
FastAPI server
Frontend pages:

Home page
Dashboard
Agents page
Narrative page



Next, I should implement:

Economy page (for visualizing the economic aspects of the simulation)
A project README with setup instructions
Any missing configuration files for ensuring the project structure is complete

Let me start with the Economy page, which will show economic indicators, markets, and interactions.

ProtoNomia: Cyberpunk Mars Economic Simulation
I've designed ProtoNomia, a sophisticated economic simulation set in a cyberpunk Mars colony in the year 2993. This project combines multi-agent simulation, game theory principles, and narrative generation to create an engaging platform for exploring economic interactions.
Project Overview
ProtoNomia simulates a Mars colony where agents (individuals, corporations, and collectives) interact through various economic games such as the Ultimatum Game, Trust Game, and Public Goods Game. Each agent is powered by a Language Model (LLM) that makes decisions based on its personality, resources, and social context.
Key Features

LLM-Powered Agents: Agents make decisions using Ollama-based LLMs with structured outputs via Instructor
Economic Game Theory: Implementation of multiple classic economic interactions
Agent Lifecycle: Realistic birth, aging, and death mechanics with population control
Narrative Generation: Automatic creation of compelling stories from agent interactions
Cyberpunk Setting: Mars colony in 2993 with digital economy and transplanetary trade
Real-time Visualization: Interactive dashboard with economic indicators and agent details

Technical Architecture
The project is divided into two main components:
Backend (Python)

Simulation Engine: Core logic handling agent interactions and simulation state
Economic Interactions: Modular system for different game theory interactions
LLM Integration: Structured prompting system for agent decision-making
Narrative Generator: Creates stories from significant events
FastAPI Server: RESTful API and WebSockets for real-time updates

Frontend (Next.js)

Dashboard: Overview of simulation state with key metrics
Agent Explorer: Detailed view of agent population and individual profiles
Economy View: Economic indicators, market data, and interaction statistics
Narrative Chronicle: Story view with events and narrative arcs
Real-time Updates: WebSocket integration for live simulation data

Implementation Details
Core Models
I've designed Pydantic models to represent entities in the simulation:

Agent: Represents individuals or organizations with attributes like personality, resources, and skills
EconomicInteraction: Models economic games between agents
NarrativeEvent: Captures significant events for storytelling
AgentAction: Represents decisions made by agents

Economic Games
The initial MVP implements three classic economic games:

Ultimatum Game: Tests fairness norms and bargaining behavior
Trust Game: Measures trust and reciprocity between agents
Public Goods Game: Examines cooperation in group resource contribution

LLM Agent Integration
Agents make decisions via LLMs using structured prompts that provide:

Current agent state (resources, needs, location)
Social context (neighboring agents, relationships)
Available actions (REST, OFFER, NEGOTIATE, WORK, etc.)
Recent memory and history

The system uses Instructor for enforcing structured LLM outputs via Pydantic models.
Narrative Generation
The narrative system:

Creates event descriptions from interactions
Identifies patterns to form narrative arcs
Generates agent backgrounds
Produces daily/weekly summaries of significant events

Getting Started
The project includes comprehensive setup scripts and documentation:

setup.py: Automates environment setup
requirements.txt: Python dependencies
Startup scripts for backend and frontend
Detailed README with project structure

Future Extensions
The MVP implements core functionality, with TODOs for extending the project:

Additional economic interactions (Cournot, Bertrand, etc.)
More sophisticated population dynamics
Coalition formation mechanics
Advanced visualization with network graphs
Agent learning over time

This project provides a flexible framework for exploring economic principles in a narrative-rich, agent-based simulation that brings theoretical concepts to life in an engaging cyberpunk Mars setting.

Implementation Review against Original Request
Let me summarize your original request:

Create ProtoNomia, a simulation to assess economic theory principles, especially cooperation vs. defection
Make it scientifically sound yet entertaining and didactic
Use Python for the multi-agent simulation backend
Create a Next.js frontend with real-time analytics
Define Pydantic models for agents flexible enough to support 20+ economic interactions
Set it in a cyberpunk Mars colony in 2993 with a transplanetary economy
Include a Narrator that generates stories from agent interactions
Implement lifecycle mechanics (birth, aging, death) with population control
For MVP, implement basic lifecycle, population initialization, narrator, and a few economic interactions

You later specified that agents should be LLM-based using Ollama with specific parameters (timeout=5s, retry=3) and a structured decision-making process.
Implementation vs. File Structure Review
I've created a good foundation but there are several missing or incomplete components:

Missing Files:

population/controller.py - Population lifecycle management
economics/interactions/ directory structure (instead used a single file)
Some agent-related files like behavior.py and lifecycle.py


Implementation Gaps:

Ollama integration needs refinement to match your exact specifications
Population control mechanics are not fully implemented
Only 3 of 20 economic interactions are implemented
Need better modularization according to the project structure



Let me address these issues, starting with the most critical components:
Let me now update the agent lifecycle implementation and refine the LLM agent controller to better match your specifications:
Now let's restructure the economics interactions into a proper directory structure with separate files for each game type:
Let's create the base interaction handler class:
Now let's implement each of the game-specific handlers in separate files. First, the Ultimatum Game:
Now let's implement the Trust Game handler:
Let's implement the Public Goods Game handler:
