# Test-Driven Development: You MUST have tests covering new components, you MUST always test your changes
- We run under venv `source ~/.virtualenvs/protonomia/bin/activate` that requires qualified imports from root e.g. `from models.agents import X`
- You must test simple changes with `pytest tests/your/new/test/file.py` to validate your own changes easily.
- You MUST test each unit of work against the whole fast tests unit testsuite: `pytest tests/unit/`
- You SHOULD test each bigger unit of work against the whole testsuite: `pytest tests/`
- You SHOULD test that the simulation runs, and communicates well with the LLM, using "PYTHONPATH=`pwd`python headless.py --initial-population 4 --ticks 10 --verbosity 4 --log-level DEBUG --resource-scarcity 0.1"
- When writing tests, place fast ones in tests/unit/ and place any test interacting for real with LLMS under tests/llm/
- Prefer updating/completing existing tests to creating new files - always check for an existing related test before creating a new one.
